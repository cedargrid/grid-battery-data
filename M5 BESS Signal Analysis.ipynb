    "- Establish a more optimized method for storing the M5 data on disk and in memory\n",
    "- Provide a high level summary of the battery system operation \n",
    "- Decode the primary control signals the BESS sends to the batteries. \n",
    "  - Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) - a frequency support service the plant provides the grid\n",
    "  - Set Point Adjustment (SPA) - a state of charge management algorithm "

The theory is that when frequency is high, there is a relative shortage of load and when frequency is low, there is a shortage of generation on the grid. Because bad things can happen when the grid is deviates from the nominal frequency, the battery used is as a stabilizing force. This is a common mode of operation for utility scale batteries.\n",
