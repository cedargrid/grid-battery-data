    "As for the 12 hour autocorrelation we saw above, we see that both early morning (4-7) and early afternoon (16-19) have low frequencies, whereas late morning and late evening have high frequencies. However, I suspect that the exact shift (12-hours) is essentially coincidental and not because it's half a day."
